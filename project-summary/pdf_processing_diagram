:Load PDF;
note right of Load PDF
    - Load PDF from file system or URL
    - Prepare the PDF content for processing
end note

' Chunking the PDF
:Chunk PDF into smaller pieces;

    - Example chunk size could be 250 characters or 1 page
end note

' Embedding Process
:Create Embeddings for each chunk;
note right of Create Embeddings
    - Use NLP models like BERT or GPT to embed text chunks
    - Convert each chunk to vector format
end note

' Store Embeddings in Chroma DB

' Query Process
:Query Chroma DB for relevant information;
note right of Query Chroma DB
    - Once embeddings are stored, queries can be made to the Chroma DB
    - Ask questions related to the document
    - Retrieve the most relevant chunks based on vector similarity
end note
